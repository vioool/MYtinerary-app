# MYtinerary-app

STATE OF THE PROJECT: • Working on the login page and functionality (with PASSPORT).
• Work on ablilaty to generate new tokens and verify tokens
• Next step:implement Update City

TASK: Create a simple to use and intuitive interface for the app-manager of a travelsharing platform. 
The manager wants to be able to manipulate which data in the app will be fetched and presented. 

PROCESS: • Writing predeﬁned operations and testing them in Postman
• Creating forms on the front end, to making API calls in the Action Generators and returning the data to the store.

CHALLANGE: • Get into the new syntax of React and understanding REDUX as statemanagement. It was confusing at first but
once I learned to work with components I started to get an overview and loved it.
• Different steps to go through to get the back end working. Going through the same steps over again was for me the way to learn.

WHAT I LOVE: • Learning something completely new again. I love that. • Being able to write CRUD-API's is exciting and 
to bring structure the database collection.
